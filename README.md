# Note on Architecture:

The Pabuyan Backend was built using Strapi (Headless CMS). At the time of development, since I was still strengthening my core backend foundations, I chose Strapi to ensure the client received a robust, fully editable dashboard for content management without compromising project deadlines.

For data persistence, the project uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon Console, ensuring a scalable and high-performance serverless database solution.
